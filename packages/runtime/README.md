# Elemend: A Frontend Framework for Declarative UI Development

## Overview

Elemend is a cutting-edge frontend framework designed to simplify the process of building dynamic and interactive web applications. It allows developers to focus on describing what they want the view of their application to look like, while the framework takes care of the DOM manipulation, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Problem Statement

Before frontend frameworks existed, mixing application logic and DOM manipulation code would quickly become unwieldy. Implementing both the business logic and the code to update the DOM for every user interaction event led to a hard-to-maintain and cluttered codebase. This is because two different levels of abstraction, application logic and DOM manipulation, were mixed together, resulting in a maintenance nightmare.

## Solution

Elemend is built to resolve this issue by allowing developers to write declarative code that describes what the view should look like, without specifying how to build it. This approach separates the concerns of what needs to be built (handled by the developers) and how itâ€™s built (handled by Elemend), leading to more efficient and maintainable code.

## Key Features

- Declarative Syntax: Write code that describes what the view should look like, and let Elemend handle the rest.
- Abstraction Over DOM Manipulation: No need to deal with low-level Document API for DOM manipulation.
- Clean and Maintainable Codebase: Keep application logic and DOM manipulation separate for easier maintenance.
- Efficient Rendering: Elemend ensures optimal performance for rendering views and updating the DOM.
